    <h4> Questions </h4>
    <ul>
      <li> <h5> What's your level of HTML experience? (1-10) </h5>

      <p> 3. I took Web Design my sophomore year of high school, so I have experience but it was pretty basic and it's been a long time. I haven't really done anything with CSS so that'll be completely new. I am really excited to learn more about it though. </p>

      <h5> What do you hope to learn from this class? </h5>

      <p> I hope to expand my skills in web development, I would really like to be able to make my own website for personal use and if this class can help me get a strong basis for that, then I would really love that. </p>
