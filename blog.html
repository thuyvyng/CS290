          <h4> Assignment 1: 4/6/19 </h4>
          <p> This assignment was pretty easy. I had already learned these basics back in high school.
            I guess the hardest part was trying to decide a fun fact about myself. That really puts me on the spot.
            I also had trouble finding how to post the blog so I checked Piazza, and someone had posted
            a link on how to fix this issue. All I did was click a button and it was "Reset Web Directory"
            and it fixed all my issues.  </p>
            </li>
          <li class = "entry">
          <h4> Assignment 2: 4/17/19 </h4>
          <p> This assignment was as expected. I felt like everything in class had adaquately prepared me for class.
            I had some trouble with flexboxes, but that's probabaly only because I started the assignment before Friday
            as Hess said we would go over them more. So I had to google some things about flexboxes.
            I also had trouble noticing a lot of the litte details on the assignments.
            I didn't even notice the curose change or the focus of the search bar, so thank goodness my friend
            told me that I missed it. I should probably be more attentive in the future.</p>
            </li>
            <li class = "entry">
            <h4> Assignment 3: 5/7/19 </h4>
            <p> I think the hardest part of the assignment was trying to find the right function.
              For example, did I need the .change of .keypress or .keydown. So it was a lot of testing
            those out and seeing if those were what I wanted. I also thought adding a new DOM element was tricky
            just because I made it more unorganzied than it should have been so I wasted a couple of minuted reordering
          things. I felt like this was a really good assignment. It was not too difficult but it wasn't busy work. I
        felt like it perfectly expanded on things we learned in class. For resources I used I mainly used class notes, code,
      and sometimes I would google things that didn't fully make sense to me in the notes like what is the difference between
    .change and all of those. </p>
              </li>

              <li class = "entry">
              <h4> Assignment 4: 5/18/19 </h4>
              <p> This assignment was definetly the hardest yet and the one I needed the most help on. I spent almost an hour trying to figure
              the ports and how to do it locally alone. One of the TAs posted something about bash and I did it and it worked
            but honestly I'm a little unsure how. The routing stuff was actually pretty easy. But the cache stuff was not, I had to google
          to so much about path, fs, and all of the functions. I think I spent more time googling function than I did actually coding, learned a lot tho!</p>

                  <h4> Assignment 5: 6/1/19 </h4>
                  <p> Definetly the hardest assignment. It was all pretty easy until the last step. I didn't know how to pass in a specific array index,
                  as opposed to the whole array. I tried looking it up online and that didn't help. I ended up just console.log -ing it until I figured out how
                manipulate it to look like tweets:twitData did when I console.log-ged it and that worked.  </p>
